framework
 - reuse pre-written code(templates)

Spring
	- powerful & lightweight application development framework
	-  a framework of frameworks because it supports various framework like struts,
	hibernate,EJB & JSF

Features
1. Lightweight
2. Inversion of Control(IoC)
	- loosely coupling
3. Aspect Oriented Programming(AOP)
	- by separating the application business logic from system service
4. Container
	- creates & manages life of cycle & configuration of application objects
5. MVC Framework
	- configurable via interface & accommodates multiple view technologies
6. Transaction Management
	- provides a generic abstraction layer

Why we used Spring?
1. works on POJO(Plain Old Java Object)
		by using this our application will be lightweight
2. predefined templates for JDBC,Hibernate,JPA
3. Because of Dependency Injection(DI), our code becomes loosely coupled
4. development becomes faster
5. supports for transaction,validation,caching
