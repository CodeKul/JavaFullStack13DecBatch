Generics
 - allow us to create a single class,interface & method that can be used with different
    data types
 - parametrised type

 Advantages:
 1. Code Re-usability
 2. Compile Time Checking
 3. Used with Collection

 Collection
    - root interface of collections framework hierarchy
1. List(I)
	- an ordered collection,follows the insertion order
	- store & access elements sequentially
2. ArrayList(C)
	- provides the functionality of resizable-arrays
	- implements List(I)
	- methods are not synchronised

3. Vector(C)
	- implements List(I)
	- create resizable-arrays similar to ArrayList
	- methods are synchronised
4. Stack(C)
	- elements are stored & accessed in Last In First Out(LIFO) manner
	- elements are added to the top of the stack & removed from top of the stack
	- extends Vector class
5. LinkedList(C)
	- data structure Doubly-linked list
	- 3 fields
		a) prev
			- stores an address of prev element
		b) data
			- stores the actual data
		c) next
			- stores an address of next element
6. Set(I)
	- cannot contains duplicate element
	- added only one null value
	- unordered collection, it does not follow the insertion order
7. TreeSet(C)
	- elements from tree-set are sorted
8. LinkedHashSet(C)
9. Queue(I)
	- elements are stored & accessed in First In First Out(FIFO) manner
10. Priority Queue(C)
	- unordered
	- not a thread safe
11. Deque
	- Double Ended Queue
	- pronounce as Deck
	- used as a stack or queue
12. ArrayDeque
	- not thread-safe
	- Null elements are prohibited

13. Map
	- stored key & value pair
	- keys are unique, values can be duplicate
	- accepts only one null key, accepts more than one null values
	- by using key we can access or modify the values
14. HashMap
	- stored key & value pair
	- keys are unique, values can be duplicate
	- non synchronised
 Note:
 1. Generics does not work with primitive data types
