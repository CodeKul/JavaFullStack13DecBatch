Generics
 - allow us to create a single class,interface & method that can be used with different
    data types
 - parametrised type

 Advantages:
 1. Code Re-usability
 2. Compile Time Checking
 3. Used with Collection

 Collection
    - root interface of collections framework hierarchy
1. List(I)
	- an ordered collection
	- store & access elements sequentially
2. ArrayList(C)
	- provides the functionality of resizable-arrays
	- implements List(I)
	- methods are not synchronised

3. Vector(C)
	- implements List(I)
	- create resizable-arrays similar to ArrayList
	- methods are synchronised
4. Stack(C)
	- elements are stored & accessed in Last In First Out(LIFO) manner
	- elements are added to the top of the stack & removed from top of the stack
 Note:
 1. Generics does not work with primitive data types
