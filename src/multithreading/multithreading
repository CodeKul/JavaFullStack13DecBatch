**Thread
- lightweight process
- smallest unit
- independent
- if there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads
- shared the memory area


Multitasking
- a process executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
2 ways to achieve multitasking
1. Multiprocessing
	- heavyweight
	- has a address in memory
	- cost of communication between the process is high
	- switching from one process to another process requires some time

2. MultiThreading
	- a process of executing multiple threads
	- lightweight
	- sharing the address space
	- cost of communication between thread is low

Life cycle of Thread
1. New(Born)
2. Runnable
3. Running
4. waiting/blocked
5. Terminated/Dead

There are 2 ways to create thread in java
1. by extending thread class
2. by implementing Runnable interface

Notes:
1. we required at least one process to execute the thread
2. at a time one thread is executed only
