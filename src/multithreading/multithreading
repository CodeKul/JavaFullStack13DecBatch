**Thread
- lightweight process
- smallest unit
- independent
- if there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads
- shared the memory area


Multitasking
- a process executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
2 ways to achieve multitasking
1. Multiprocessing
	- heavyweight
	- has a address in memory
	- cost of communication between the process is high
	- switching from one process to another process requires some time

2. MultiThreading
	- a process of executing multiple threads
	- lightweight
	- sharing the address space
	- cost of communication between thread is low
    - by default in every java application we have at least one thread - main thread


Life cycle of Thread
1. New(Born)
	- when we create a thread object, thread is born

2. Runnable
	- when the start() method is invoked that time new thread enters into
	runnable state
	- ready for execution
	- waiting for availability of the processor(CPU)

3. Running
	- execution of thread
	- when TS selects a thread from runnable state, it goes into running state

4. waiting/blocked
	- when a thread is suspended,sleeping or waiting for some time then it is in blocked/
	waiting state

5. Terminated/Dead
	- when stop() method is called
	- when thread run() method completes its execution

Thread Scheduler
 - part of JVM
 - decides which thread to run or execute  & which thread to wait
 - thread is selected only from runnable state
 - if there is more than one thread in runnable state, then it's up to TS to pick one thread

There are 2 ways to create thread in java
1. by extending thread class
	step:
		a) extends class with Thread class
		b) override run()
		c) create an object of extended class
		d) invoked start()
2. by implementing Runnable interface
		a) implementing class with Runnable interface
		b) override run()
		c) create an object of implemented class
		d) create an object of thread class to pass implemented class object as an argument
		e) invoked start()

Methods:
1. void run()
	- used to perform action on a thread

2. void start()
	- starts the execution of the thread.JVM calls the run() method

3. Thread currentThread()
	-  Returns a reference to the currently executing thread object

4. void sleep(long ms)
	- sleep current executing thread for specified no of ms
	- throws the exception IllegalArgumentException when the time for sleeping is negative

5. void join()
	- to pause the execution of a current thread until unless the specified thread is dead.
	why we use join() method?
		- Our program can have any number of threads.TS decides which thread will get executed.
		- But  TS doesn't give guarantee to the the order of execution of threads.So, every time
		we run the code may get different result.
		- Suppose we go with sleep() method, it pauses the execution of thread for specific time period
		but we can not predict the exact execution time of a thread

6.  String getName()
	- returns thread name

7. void setName(String nm)
	- change name to the thread

8. int getPriority()
9. void setPriority(int newPriority)
10. void setDaemon(boolean on)
11. boolean isDaemon()

12. void yield()
	- to give the hint to TS a & gives chance to other thread
	- current running thread give chance to other thread
	- it causes the currently executing thread object to pause & allow other threads to
	execute

13. void wait()
	- defined in Object class
	- to give up the lock & go to sleep until some other threads calls notify() or notifyAll()
	- final method
	- can be called only from within a synchronised block or synchronised method otherwise an exception
	will occur(IllegalMonitorStateException)

14. void notify()
	- to wakes up a single thread that called wait() method.
	- final method


15. void notifyAll()
	- to wake up all threads  that called wait() method



3 Thread Priority constants:
1. MIN_PRIORITY
	- value of MIN_PRIORITY is 1
2. NORM_PRIORITY
	- Default priority of a thread is 5
3. MAX_PRIORITY
	- value of MAX_PRIORITY is 10

Daemon Thread
	- a service provider thread that provides service to the user thread.
	- life of these threads are depend on user threads
	- i.e when all the user threads terminated/dies, then JVM terminates these threads automatically
	- eg. Garbage Collector
	- low priority thread
	- provides services to user threads for background supporting task
	- to serve user threads

DeadLock
 - occur in a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock,
  that is acquired by another thread & second thread is
 waiting for an object lock that is acquired by first thread.
 Since, both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock

Synchronisation
	- if we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.
	- prevent thread interference
	- prevent consistency problem

  Types
1. Process
2. Thread Synchronisation
	a) Mutual Exclusive
		it will helps keep threads from interfering with one another
			1. Synchronized method
			2. Synchronized block
				- synchronizes portion of method
			3. static synchronization
				- lock will be on the class
	b) Cooperation(Inter-Thread communication)
		- allowing synchronised threads to communicate with each other
		- wait(),notify(),notifyAll()


Thread Pool
	- a group of worker threads that are waiting for task & reused many times
	- collection of pre-initialized threads
	- facilitates the execution of N number of tasks using the same thread
	- when any thread completes its execution , it can pickup a new task from the queue and execute it
	- when all tasks are completed the threads remain active and wait for more tasks in the thread pool
 ThreadPoolExecutor :
    - separates the task creation & its execution
 Advantages
 1. better performance
 2. saves time
 3. no need to create a thread again & again
 4. easy to access

Can we start a thread twice?
- No, After starting a thread,it can never be started again
- If we do this, we will get IllegalThreadStateException

What if we call run() method directly?



Notes:
1. we required at least one process to execute the thread
2. at a time one thread is executed only
3. if we want to make user thread as a Daemon thread then we must not be started
	that thread. Otherwise it will throw IllegalThreadStateException
4. Thread priorities cannot guarantee that a higher priority thread will always be executed first
	than the lower priority thread.
   The selection of the threads for execution depends upon the thread scheduler

Homework
1. Difference between Thread & Process
2. difference between yield() & join() & sleep()
