- to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of application
  can be maintained

Exception
- abnormal condition

2 Types of Exception
1. Checked Exception(compile time exception)
	- these exceptions are checked @ the compile time

2. Unchecked Exception(run time exception)
	- these exceptions are checked @ the run time

3. Error
	- irrecoverable

Hierarchy :

Throwable
	- Exception
		- IOException
		- SqlException
		- ClassNotFoundException
		- FileNotFoundException
		- RuntimeException
			- ArithmeticException
			- NullPointerException
			- IndexOutOfBoundException
			- NumberFormatException
	- Error
		- StackOverFlowError
		- OutOfMemoryError
		- VirtualMachineError

Keywords used to handle exception:
1. try
	- place an exception code
	- might or might be throw an exception
2. catch
	- to handle the exception
3. finally
	- to execute necessary code
	- eg. close connection
4. throw
	- throw the exception explicitly
5. throws
	- declare the exception
	- suppress the exception
	syntax:
	void display() throws exception_class name{
		//method code
	}
	- checked exceptions are declared only

Nested Try :
 - try inside another try
 - Sometimes a situation may arise where part of a block may cause one error and the entire block
 itself may cause another error. In such cases exception handlers have to be nested.

 Exception Propagation:
 - when an exception occurs within a method then if that method does not handle that exception object
 will be propagated to caller then the call method is responsible that exception.
 - an exception is thrown from the top of the stack & if it not cought , then it drops down the call stack

Notes :
1. At a time only one exception occurs and ar a time only one catch block is executed
2. All catch block must be ordered from most specific to most general

Homework
1. Handle ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
	int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
	sout(a[6]);

2. Age criteria for vaccine
	Group 1
	Group 2 - 45 - 60 - eligible for vaccine
	Group 3
3. Bank
	//Menu driven
	withdraw() - decrement
		- initialAmount < withdraw
			throw Custom Exception
		else
			complete the transaction
			if amount is 0
			then "you need to deposit money first"

	deposit() - increment
	display() - balance

4. Difference between throw & throws
5. Difference between final vs finally vs finalize
