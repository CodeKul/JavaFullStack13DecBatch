1.String s1 = "abc";
  String s2 = "abc";
  System.out.println("s1 == s2 is:" + s1 == s2);

2.String s3 = "JournalDev";
  int start = 1;
  char end = 5;
  System.out.println(start + end);
  System.out.println(s3.substring(start, end));

3.try {
  	if (flag) {
  		while (true) {
  		}
  	} else {
  		System.exit(1);
  	}
  } finally {
  	System.out.println("In Finally");
  }

4.String str = null;
  String str1="abc";
  System.out.println(str1.equals("abc") | str.equals(null));

5.String x = "abc";
  String y = "abc";
  x.concat(y);
  System.out.print(x);
