Types of polymorphism:

1. Compile-time polymorphism or static polymorphism - method overloading(achieve)
2. Run time polymorphism (Dynamic Method dispatch) or Dynamic polymorphism - method overriding(achieve)

poly -> many
morph -> forms
eg. 1. water - solid -ice, liquid -water, gas -vapour
    2. sound - dog -bark, lion -roar, cat -meow

Note: Runtime polymorphism can't achieved by data members


 Method Overloading      Method Overriding
 1. same name            1. same name
 2. same class           2. diff class
 3. no. of args          3. same no. of args,must have same parameters,return type must be same
 4. diff data types      4. when two classes have is-a relationship(inheritance)

 class A{
 void show(String n){}
 }
 class B extends A{
 void show(String n){}
 }
