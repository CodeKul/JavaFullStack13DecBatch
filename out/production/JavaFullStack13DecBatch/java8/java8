- release March 14

Features:
1. forEach() method
	- Iterable interface

2. default & static methods in interface
	default method:
	- allow interface to have methods with implementation without affecting the classes
	that implement the interface
	- Default  methods are also known as Defender methods or virtual extension methods
	- provide backward compatibility so existing interfaces can use without implementing the
	default methods in the class
	static method:


3. Functional Interface & Lambda Expressions
	- an interface with exactly one abstract method
	- it is not mandatory to use annotation but we can use functional interface to avoid
	addition of extra methods
	- benefit of java 8 functional interfaces is that we can use lambda expressions
	-

4. Method Reference
	- prerequisites are functional interface & lambda
5. Optional
6. Stream API

7. Java Time API

8. Collection API improvement

9. Concurrency API improvement

8. I/O improvement


Homework:
1.
interface I1{
	default void display(){
		// lines of code
	}
}
interface I2{
	default void display(){
		// lines of code
	}
}
class TestInterface implements I1,I2{
	main(){
		//lines of code
	}
}
