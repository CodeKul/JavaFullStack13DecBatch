Method Overloading
 - a class has multiple methods with same name but with diff arguments or parameters

Ex .
void add(int a,int b)

void add(int a,int b,int c)

void add(float a,float b)

ways
1. by changing no. of arguments
2. by changing the data type

Note : Method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of method only
