Object Oriented Programming

1. Object - real world entity. Pen,chair,tables - states(properties) and behaviours
            instance of class,
            contains an address(memory address).


2. Class - collection objects.(logical entity)
           a blueprint.
           doesn't consume any space
           contains methods,fields,constructor,blocks,nested classes & interface


3.Inheritance - when one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object.
                provide code reusability.
                achieve polymorphism(runtime)

4. Polymorphism - one form of many things
                  one tasks is performed in diff ways
                  use method overloading and method overriding

5 Abstraction - hiding internal details & showing functionality

6. Encapsulation - wrapping up data together into single unit
