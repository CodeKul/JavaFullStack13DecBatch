- used for memory management
- we can apply static keyword with :
1. variable
        - stored in Method/class Area
        - get the memory only once,when class loaded in memory
        - it saves the memory
        - share among all the instance of class
2. method
		- belongs to class
		- without creating an object or instance of class we can call or invoked static method
		- static method can access only static data
3. block
		- when class is loaded & before creating an object & before main method static block executes only once
		- used to initialize static data(fields)
		- static block can access only static data
4. class
