- a process of wrapping code & data into single unit
Ex. Capsule

class Student{

   private int rollNo;// data members

}
Advantage:
1. make the data members read only or write only
2. control over the data
3. achieve data hiding

Homework :
1. Employee
        int id
        String name
        double salary //write only
        double bonus  //read only
        String email
   Create double calculateBonus() - salary + bonus
