Keywords used to handle exception:
1. try
	- place an exception code
	- might or might be throw an exception
2. catch
	- to handle the exception
3. finally
	- to execute necessary code
	- eg. close connection
4. throw
	- throw the exception explicitly
5. throws
	- declare the exception

Nested Try :
 - try inside another try
 - Sometimes a situation may arise where part of a block may cause one error and the entire block
 itself may cause another error. In such cases exception handlers have to be nested.

Notes :
1. At a time only one exception occurs and ar a time only one catch block is executed
2. All catch block must be ordered from most specific to most general
