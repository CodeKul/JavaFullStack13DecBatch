Abstraction:
- hiding internal/implementation details & showing only functionality to the user
- shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal impl

ways to achieve abstraction
1. abstract class
2. interface

Abstract class:
1. class which declared with abstract keyword.
Syntax-
 abstract class_name{
    // abstract methods - methods which are declared with abstract keyword
    // non-abstract methods
 }

Notes:
1. class must be declared with abstract keyword if class contains abstract methods

2. class have abstract & non-abstract methods

3. class cannot be instantiated(cannot create object of abstract class)

4. class can have constructors & static methods

5. class can have final methods
