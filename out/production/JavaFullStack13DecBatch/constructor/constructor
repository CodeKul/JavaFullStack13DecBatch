class Student{
    int rollNo;
    String name;
    Student(){ //Default constructor
    }
    Student(rollNo,name){ //Parameterised
    }
}

1. it is block of code similar to method
2. it is called when instance of class is created
3. at the time of calling constructor memory for the object is allocated in memory
4. when the object is created by using new keyword that time constructor gets called
5. if there is no constructor in class that time java compiler provides default constructor implicitly

Types
1. Default - no args - used to provide default values to the object
2. Parameterised

Rules:
1. constructor name is same as our class name
2. constructor should not have return type(explicitly)
3. constructors cannot be abstract,static,final and synchronised
4. constructors can have access modifiers(public,private,protected or default)
