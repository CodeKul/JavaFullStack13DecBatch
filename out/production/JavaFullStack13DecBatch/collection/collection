Generics
 - allow us to create a single class,interface & method that can be used with different
    data types
 - parametrised type

 Advantages:
 1. Code Re-usability
 2. Compile Time Checking
 3. Used with Collection

 Collection
    - root interface of collections framework hierarchy
1. List(I)
	- an ordered collection,follows the insertion order
	- store & access elements sequentially
2. ArrayList(C)
	- provides the functionality of resizable-arrays
	- implements List(I)
	- methods are not synchronised

3. Vector(C)
	- implements List(I)
	- create resizable-arrays similar to ArrayList
	- methods are synchronised
4. Stack(C)
	- elements are stored & accessed in Last In First Out(LIFO) manner
	- elements are added to the top of the stack & removed from top of the stack
	- extends Vector class
5. LinkedList(C)
	- data structure Doubly-linked list
	- 3 fields
		a) prev
			- stores an address of prev element
		b) data
			- stores the actual data
		c) next
			- stores an address of next element
6. Set(I)
	- cannot contains duplicate element
	- added only one null value
	- unordered collection, it does not follow the insertion order
7. TreeSet(C)
	- elements from tree-set are sorted
8. LinkedHashSet(C)
9. Queue(I)
	- elements are stored & accessed in First In First Out(FIFO) manner
10. Priority Queue(C)
	- unordered
	- not a thread safe
11. Deque
	- Double Ended Queue
	- pronounce as Deck
	- used as a stack or queue
12. ArrayDeque
	- not thread-safe
	- Null elements are prohibited

13. Map(I)
	- stores key & value pair
	- keys are unique, values can be duplicate
	- accepts only one null key, accepts more than one null values
	- by using key we can access or modify the values
14. HashMap(C)
	- stored key & value pair
	- keys are unique, values can be duplicate
	- non synchronised
	- doesn't maintain any order

	- equals()
	    * checks equality of 2 objects.It compares keys,whether keys are equal or not.
	    * a method of the Object class
	    * can be overridden
	    * it is mandatory to override the hashCode()
	- hashCode()
		* a method of the Object class
		* returns the memory ref of the object in integer form.
		* the value received from this method is used as bucket no
		* bucket no is the address of the element inside the map
		* hash code of null key is 0
	- buckets
		* array of node
		* each node has a data structure like a LinkedList
		* more than one node can have same bucket
	- calculating index index = hashcode(key) & (N-1)
15. LinkedHashMap
	- a Hashtable & linked list implementation
	- maintains a doubly linked list running thro all of its entries
	- follows insertion order
	- non-synchronised
	- maintains insertion order
	- may contains one null key & multiple null values
16. TreeMap
	- a red-black tree implementation
	- storing key-value pair in sorted order
	- contains only unique elements
	- cannot have a null key but it can have multiple null values
	- non-synchronised
	- maintains ascending order

17. EnumSet
	- abstract class
	- cannot have null element
18. EnumMap
	- stores key & value pair

Hashing:
	- process of converting an object into an integer value,The integer value helps in indexing & faster search

Enum:
	- Enumeration
	- purpose is to represent group of constants
	- a data type which contains a fixed set of constants


Collections:
	- consists exclusively of static methods

Comparable:
	-  java.lang
	- having only one method i.e int compareTo()
	- provides single sorting sequence
Comparator:
	- java.util
	- order the objects
	- having two methods
		a) int compare()
		b) boolean equals()
	- provides multiple sorting sequence

 Note:
 1. Generics does not work with primitive data types
 2. String class & wrapper classes are implements the Comparable interface.

 How hashmap works internally?
 HashTable in collection?
 Difference between HashTable & HashMap?
 Difference between Collection, Collections, collection
 Difference Between Comparable & Comparator
 Explain equals() & hashcode()

 Create Class Emp{
    Integer empId;
    String name;
    String mobile;
 }
 class EmpImp{
    main(){
        list 1 = add the data;
        list 2 = unique records

    }
 }
eg
list 1
 1  A   986
 2  B   456
 3  C   258
 4  D   986

list 2
 1  A   986
 2  B   456
 3  C   258
